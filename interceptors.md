# Interceptors
<img src="/images/RestJS-framework-interceptors.jpg"/>

Interceptors are like [pipes](pipes.md) with some differences.
If you've passed [pipes](pipes.md) session, you should know that we use pipes for transformation and validation . 
Pipes control only the in-coming message, not out-coming message.

Sometimes you need to transform the result message that is generated by the controller.
